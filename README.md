# Microbit_Lower_case_to_Upper_case
Changes the text case to the opposite

# Controls
1. Type to the code the word you want to change - from "the upper to lower" or "upper to lower" case. *the word must contain only upper or lower case or it will show you "X")
2. When the microbit is pluged and enabled, it will show you the word and then triangle icon.
- "<" = from lower case to upper case
- ">" = from upper case to lower case
3. You can switch between those two options with the buttons "A" or "B".
4. If you are satisfied with your option, click both of the buttons at the same time to confirm it. Now you can see the results.
*if the microbit shows you "X", that means that you didn't write the text correctly = all the letters are not in only upper or lower case)
5. The microbits ends by itself because it has now nothing to do. To send new word to microbit, you have to plug it again to your computer and change it manually.
*If you want to write the letters on microbit, make sure to check my other repositories ("Microbit - receiver and transmitter" exactly). I did something similar there. Copy part of the code from there and put some creativity to it ("when shaken = reset all" for example) and you have an independent microbit.*
